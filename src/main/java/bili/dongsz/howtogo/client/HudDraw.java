 * road lines, circular markers, turn arrows or rounded cards. Everything here builds on a single
 * position-colour layer with depth testing off, so the results can be drawn over the world as well
 * as over a screen.
 *
 * <p><b>Draw all text after all shapes.</b> {@code GuiGraphics.drawString} flushes the buffer
 * source, which ends the QUADS {@code BufferBuilder} behind a consumer obtained from
 * {@link #consumer}. Emitting one more quad through that stale consumer throws
 * {@code IllegalStateException: Not building!} and takes the whole frame -- and with it the game --
 * down. Mixing the two inside one quad sequence is the trap; a label pass belongs at the tail.
